## Slack & Pull Requests

We have a dedicated Slack channel for posting PRs: #engineering-prs. Every PR should be posted in this channel, allowing for others to know that you have work that needs review. Communicating updates about the PR will happen in a thread attached to the original Slack message for the PR.

The process for posting a PR in Slack is:

* Post your PR in #engineering-prs
* If you are the developer reviewing the PR, start a thread, saying: `@<developer_who_made_PR> reviewing`
* If the PR needs to be pushed back, the developer reviewing responds in the thread with: `pushing back to In Progress @<developer_who_made_PR>`.
* If all comments have been addressed, the developer responds in the thread with: `@<developer_who_made_the_comment> all comments have been addressed. Pushing back to Needs Review`
* If you have approved the PR, respond in the thread with: `@<developer_who_made_PR> approved`

**Please note that all discussion about the PR should stay in GitHub.** Threads are not intended a place to discuss the code itself. Slack is only used to provide more immediate feedback.

## Slack and Communication

All communication about projects should be in #engineering. Do not use direct messages unless you are discussing something private. It is important that all conversations and questions (no matter how small they seem) should be in #engineering. We work as a team and that requires sharing, being transparent, and allowing the whole team to have a chance to answer your questions and to learn from the dialogue.
